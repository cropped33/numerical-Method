5. Implement Lagrange's Interpolation.

Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Read number of data n.
3. Read data X[i] and Y[i] for i=1 to n.
4. Read Xp for which Yp is to be determined.
5. Initialize Yp =0.

6. for i= 1 to n 
    set p=1
    for j=1 to n 
        if i != j then
            calculate p = p*(Xp-Xj)/ (Xi-Xj)
            Next j
        calculate Yp = Yp + p*Yi
        Next i

    7. Display Yp.
    8. STOP
